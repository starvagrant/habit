### Tweaks: 

- Could use an additional color system for more fine grained control over habits.

- Could use an alert box for leveling up. So I can watch the system's behavior 
as I continue to mark habit completed. 

- CSS as always. Some borders could help with readability


### Problems: 

- troublesome PHP notice showing up in error log

- Habit Experience in SQL TABLES should not reset to 0. It should keep growing. 
	The Experience / 128 information should be calculated as requested.

- introduced awkward object, could use some refactoring
